It all started in 1908 whit the Annexation Crisis over Bosnia in which both the Ottoman Empire and Austrian Empire had claims over Bosnia,in our timeline the crisis laid the ground for The Great War but in this one it started T.G.W.
In 1909 The Ottoman Empire mobilized the troops at the border whit Bosnia and Austria, But the Ottoman Empire not being aware of the Balkan League being formed between Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria in that weak as the League was secretly formed, the Balkan Nations started to mobilize at Ottoman Borders.
The command in Vien Received the news from the Balkans and mobilized the army in the Province of Krajina, Bosnia still not joining sides, Secretly Formed a pact whit Russia,Later that year The Balkan powers declared war on the Ottoman Empire,Austria not knowing that Bosnia was Allied whit Russia,Austria saw the advantage and started pushing in to Bosnia, Whit does events Russia joined the war,the Russian force started Pushing in to Galicia,first victory was at Lawow the Russian army took the city in 4 weeks but the Russian front will start to lose in the years to come as the German Empire Joined the war and the Russian front was lost for the allies.

As was Italy in the Central Powers they immediately joined the war in interest in Savoy and Nice,They would start the push on the France border in 1909, as the Germans would push in the north,Italy would face a major victory over savoy and nice and would annex theme and leave the war immediately a not wanting to lose theme, in 1920 a party called the Legioners started to rise in Italy and by 1923 they would gain power.
Italy would start an African campaign.

The war for Bosnia would be won by Bosnia in the Balkans as Austria started to Fall apart, as the minorities wanted Independence from the Habsburg Crown, the Austrian Economy fell, Austria will face greate inflations. And By 1911 the Austrians would Lose the following:

The US wuld eventualy Ask Canada to unite becose after the war in Europe in and the fall of the British Empire Canada was left In inflations , as all the money they had were british lira and when the Empire fell all its economy did too,the lira become worthles in the Colonies , So Canada and the Usa Wuld Eventualy Form North American Union,But whit that union 3 new nations gained freedom as they wuld not like the American-Canadian Rule:
